# EcolysisCMD
EcolysisCMD: command line tools for simulation and analysis of ecological systems, written in Rust.

**Status:** This project is in its earliest stages. Current short-term goals are:
- [ ] Provide low-compute-cost Population Viability Analysis using population-level simulation.
- [ ] Provide forward simulation of population dynamics and genetic diversity using individual-level simulation, targeting predictive modeling of organisms for reintroduction programs.

**Ultimate Goal:** Provide the backend for an easy-to-use library of tools for ecologists and managers, implemented in a user-friendly UI (separate repo), specifically emphasizing accessibility for nonprofit and community conservation applications.

**Open Source!** Feel free to contribute, provide bug reports, etc.
